## 🌟 Overview

Project Tao is a structured 6-month journey to establish mastery of mathematical foundations. This repository serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others pursuing similar paths. Here, you'll find formal proofs, concept explanations, problem solutions, and lecture notes developed using the Feynman Technique.

The journey focuses on building a deep understanding of:
- Mathematical Logic & Proof Techniques
- Axiomatic Set Theory
- Real Analysis
- Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems & Computability
- Complex Analysis
